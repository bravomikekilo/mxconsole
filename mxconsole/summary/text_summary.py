"""Implements text_summary in TensorFlow, with TensorBoard support.

The text_summary is basically a wrapper around the generic tensor_summary,
and it uses a TextSummaryPluginAsset class to record which tensor_summaries
are readable by the TensorBoard text plugin.

  Text data summarized via this plugin will be visible in the Text Dashboard

  Args:
    name: A name for the generated node. Will also serve as a series name in
      TensorBoard.
    tensor: a scalar string-type Tensor to summarize.
    collections: Optional list of ops.GraphKeys.  The collections to add the
